  <h1>Nesting</h1>
  <p>
    As we saw back in
    <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('hello')]]">
    </oj-tutorial-topic-link>
    custom element-based VComponents can be embedded directly in HTML.
    This comes in handy when integrating VComponents into existing JET
    content, including into composite components, oj-module content, or
    Visual Builder pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to being hosted within HTML, VComponents can also be nested
    inside of other VComponents.
  </p>
  <p>
    A child VComponent can be referenced by a parent in one of two forms:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>As a custom element, using the string tag name (eg. oj-greet-hello).</li>
    <li>As a VComponent, by referencing the Preact component class (eg. GreetHello).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The following sample parent component demonstrates both forms:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/hello-parent/hello-parent.tsx:</div>
    <code>
  1     import { h, Component } from 'preact';
  2     import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
  3     import { GreetHello } from 'oj-greet/hello/loader'
  4
  5     /**
  6      * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
  7      * @ojmetadata dependencies {
  8      *   "oj-greet-hello": "^1.0.0"
  9      * }
  10     */
  11    @customElement('oj-greet-hello-parent')
  12    export class GreetHelloParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
  13      render() {
  14        return (
  15          &lt;div&gt;
  16            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a custom element:&lt;/p&gt;
  17            &lt;oj-greet-hello /&gt;
  18
  19            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a VComponent:&lt;/p&gt;
  20            &lt;GreetHello /&gt;
  21          &lt;/div&gt;
  22        );
  23      }
  24    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    At line 17, the GreetHello VComponent is rendered using its custom
    element tag name.
  </p>
  <p>
    At line 20, the same VComponent is rendered, this time using the
    component class, which was imported at line #3.
  </p>
  <p>The resulting content is:</p>
  <p class="output">
    <oj-greet-hello-parent></oj-greet-hello-parent>
  </p>
  <p>
    In both cases, an &lt;oj-greet-hello&gt; custom element ends up in
    the live DOM.  The second form (specifying the VComponent class)
    is slightly more efficient, as more of the content can be rendered
    in virtual DOM before the live DOM is updated.  In addition, with the
    class-based form, the resulting custom element is minimally functional:
    it is there solely to serve (and hold the content of) the GreetHello
    implementation.  For cases where the parent component (or the application)
    intends to interact with the custom element in the live DOM, the first
    form (specifying tag name) should be used.
 </p>
 <p>
    As we will see in later sections, there are some other subtle usage
    differences between the two VComponent referencing forms.  In general,
    when authoring a parent VComponent, if a child is available as a
    VComponent, we recommend referencing the child via its VComponent class.
  </p>
  <h2>Specifying Component Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    In the above example, the GreetHelloParent component depends on
    the GreetHello child component.  This dependency is specified in two
    locations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>At line #3, where the GreetHello class is imported from the
    ‘oj-greet/hello/loader’ module.</li>
    <li>At lines #6-8, where we use the @ojmetadata annotation to specify a
    value for the dependencies metadata field.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The import is a requirement in order to ensure that the
    code compiles and that the dependency is loaded at runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    The @ojmetadata annotation is needed solely for tooling purposes.
    ojet CLI leverages the dependencies metadata to understand relationships
    between JET components.  Unfortunately, we do not currently have the ability
    to infer these dependencies based on the presence of import statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the above example, when the GreetHelloParent component is installed,
    its dependency on the GreetHello component can be discovered by
    examining the dependencies metadata.  Tools like ojet CLI and Visual
    Builder will automatically inspect this metadata and ensure that any
    dependencies (including transitive dependencies) are downloaded and
    installed.
