  <h1>State</h1>
  <p>
    So far, the VComponents that we have seen determine what content to
    render based exclusively on properties that are passed into the
    component by the parent.  Components that are fully controlled by the
    parent component are a very common case.  However, some components may
    require their own internal, render-influencing state that is not
    passed in, but rather lives locally in the component.  VComponent authors
    can leverage Preact's local state mechanism for these cases.
  </p>
  <h2>Declaring State</h2>
  <p>
    The process of declaring local state fields is very similar to the way
    that we define VComponent properties.  In both cases, we start by
    declaring a type.
  </p>
  <p>
    To see how this works, let's strain our little greeting
    component a bit further.  In addition to rendering a greeting, we will
    update our component such that it responds to clicks by displaying a goodbye
    message, ending the conversation.  We'll use a boolean local state
    field to track whether we have reached this "done" state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our greeting component state would be declared as:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    type State = {
      done: boolean;

      // Other state fields go here
    };</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    As with the properties type, we associate the state type with
    the VComponent implementation by leveraging generics.  The
    Preact component class exposes two type parameters:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>P: the first type parameter specifies the properties type</li>
    <li>S: the second type parameter specifies the state type</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Our new declaration with both type parameters looks like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    export class GreetWithState extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;, State&gt; {
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Each VComponent has access to the local state via the this.state field.
    This field must be initialized at construction time.  Initialization
    can be done in one of two ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your VComponent subclass has a constructor, local state
    can be initialized there:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    export class GreetWithState extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;, State&gt; {
      constructor() {
        this.state = {
          done: false
        };

        // Do other construction-time work here
      }
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    TypeScript also supports inline initialization of class
    fields.  This slightly more compact form works well if you do not
    otherwise need a constructor:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    export class GreetWithState extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;, State&gt; {
      state = {
        done: false
      };

      // Component implementation goes here
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Once local state has been declared and initialized, it can be
    referenced from within the render method to adjust how the
    virtual DOM content is rendered.  Like this.props, the this.state
    value is passed into render() as a convenience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's tweak our greeting component to render a different message when the
    conversation is "done":
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      render(props: Props, state: State) {
        // Derive greeting message off of the "done" state field

        const greeting = state.done ?
          'Goodbye' :
          props.preferredGreeting;

        return (
          &lt;div onClick={this._handleClick}&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;{greeting}, World!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <h2>Updating State</h2>
  <p>
    One thing that makes local state fields interesting is what happens
    when they are updated.  Updating local state has an important side
    effect: it triggers re-rendering of the component.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this.state is declared as a Readonly type.  Other than the
    initial assignment to this.state in the constructor (or class field
    initialization), neither this.state nor fields on this.state should be
    mutated directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, state updates are performed by calling the Preact Component's
    setState method.  This method has two forms.
    The first form simply takes an object
    representing the new state.  For example, we can update our "done" state
    field by calling:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      this.setState({ done: true });</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    This call will queue the state update, which will trigger an (asynchronous)
    re-render of the component with the new state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although our sample only has a single state field, components can
    have an arbitrary number of fields.  setState() accepts sparsely
    populated objects - ie. you are not required to provide values for all
    state fields.  Any new values that are provided will be merged on
    top of the current state.
  </p>
  <p>
    One potential problem with the object-based form of setState() arises
    when the new value for a state field is derived from the previous value.
    Given the asynchronous nature of this method, simply inspecting
    the current state may not be sufficient to determine what the next
    value should be.  If there is an outstanding call to setState() that has
    not yet been fully processed, this.state might not reflect the pending
    update.
  </p>
  <p>
    To better support cases where a state field's next value is dependent
    on the previous value, setState() supports a callback form.
    Rather than passing in an object representing the new state, callers
    pass in a function that takes two arguments: the "current" state and
    properties.  This callback function can inspect the state and props and
    return one of the following values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A sparsely populated object representing any state
      updates to apply.  Or...</li>
    <li>null, if no state updates are required</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When multiple calls to setState() are issued, the state updates
    are chained.  That is, the results of one call (whether object or
    callback form) are fed into the the subsequent callback.  That way,
    the callback always sees the most up to date values, and can use this
    information to correctly produce the next value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The below version of our greeting component has been modified to use
    a numeric, enum-based counter to track how engaging the interaction with
    the end user is.  After three clicks, the greeting component grows
    sufficiently uninterested to put an end to the conversation.
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-state/with-state.tsx:</div>

  <h2>Finding the Right Home for State</h2>
  <p>
    In order to demonstrate the local state APIs, we took a plain old
    stateless component and injected a bit of local state.  The result is an
    interactive component that updates itself in response to user interaction
    (clicks).
  </p>
  <p>
    While local state is a powerful tool that makes it easy to introduce
    interactive behaviors into otherwise static components, there are some
    drawbacks to relying on local state.  Introducing local
    state tends to make components more complicated.  This can make it more
    difficult for developers to reason about the behavior of the component,
    particularly when multiple pieces of state are involved.  It also makes
    testing more challenging, since ideally tests should cover all possible
    combinations of states.
  </p>
  <p>
    One other issue is that introducing local state can limit the flexibility
    of the component.  Local state is, well, local.  This means that, unlike
    with properties, parent components have no control over the stateful
    aspects of a child component.  By encoding specific stateful behaviors
    directly into the child component, we limit the use cases for which that
    component may be viable.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in our GreetWithState component, we made a decision that
    after three clicks, the conversation should be forever terminated.
    If we want to use the (admittedly not very interesting) presentational
    aspects of this component, but with slightly different behavior, we're
    out luck.  If in some other part of the app, we would like to add a new
    engagement level in between Interested and Bored, we're stuck either
    hacking on GreetWithState component to support different modes, or
    writing a second version of this component.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can reduce complexity and increase flexibility by breaking apart
    stateless presentation from stateful behaviors and delivering these
    as two separate components.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stateless, presentational component would have the following characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The component is controlled by properties that are passed
    in by the parent.</li>
    <li>Rather than responding to user interaction with local state updates,
    the component dispatches actions and lets the parent decide how to
    respond.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A typical response from a stateful parent component would be to update
    its own local state, triggering a re-render on itself.  As part of the
    re-render, the parent could render the child with new state-driven
    property values.
  </p>
  <h2>Controlled Greeting</h2>
  <p>
    Conveniently, we have already seen a stateless, presentational version
    of our greeting component.  Back in the
    <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('actions')]]">
    </oj-tutorial-topic-link> topic
    we explored the GreetWithActions component, which has the following design:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The greeting message is passed in from the parent via the preferredGreeting
      prop.</li>
    <li>A responseDetected action is fired in response to user interaction.</li>
    <li>There is no local state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We can easily refactor the stateful behavior out of our GreetWithState
    component and lift this up to a new parent component.  This might
    look something like:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-state-parent/with-state-parent.tsx:</div>

      enum EngagementLevel {
        Interested,
        Bored,
        Impatient,
        Done
      }

      type State = {
        engagement: EngagementLevel;
      };

      @customElement('oj-greet-with-state-parent')
      export class GreetWithStateParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps, State&gt; {

        state = {
          engagement: EngagementLevel.Interested
        }

        render() {
          const greeting = this.getGreeting();

          return (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This stateless child is re-rendered with new props in response to
                parent state updates:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;GreetWithActions preferredGreeting={greeting} onResponseDetected={this.handleResponse}/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          );
        }

        private getGreeting() {
          let greeting;

          switch(this.state.engagement) {
            case EngagementLevel.Bored:
              greeting = "Okay";
              break;
            case EngagementLevel.Impatient:
              greeting = "Whatever";
              break;
            case EngagementLevel.Done:
              greeting = "Later";
              break;
            default:
              greeting = "Hello";
              break;
          }

          return greeting;
        }

        private handleResponse = () =&gt; {
          this.setState((state: Readonly&lt;State&gt;) =&gt; {
            // Once we have reached the Done state, we return null
            // to indicate that no state update is needed.
            return state.engagement === EngagementLevel.Done ?
              null :
              { engagement: state.engagement + 1 };
          });
        }
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the above example, the stateless GreetWithActions child is fully
    controlled by the GreetWithStateParent.  This gives us flexibility to
    leverage the GreetWithActions components in other scenarios where we
    want to present a greeting, but possibly with different response
    behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, below we use the GreetWithActions child inside a parent
    that displays a randomly selected greeting when clicked:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-random-state-parent/with-random-state-parent.tsx:</div>
