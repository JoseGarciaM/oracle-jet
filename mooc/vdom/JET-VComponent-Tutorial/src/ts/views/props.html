  <h1>Properties</h1>
  <h2>Declaring Properties</h2>
  <p>
    So far we have seen two VComponents: GreetHello and GreetHelloParent.
    Let's face it: these components are pretty boring.  They are missing
    one very fundamental piece that we expect to encounter in most
    component APIs: properties!
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's add one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over on the composite component side of things, the process of adding
    a property starts with writing some JSON metadata.  For example,
    if we wanted to add a "preferredGreeting" property to a traditional composite
    component, we would open up the component.json file and add an
    entry along these lines:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
  "properties": {
    "preferredGreeting": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "Hello"
    }
  }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    We would then reference this property from the composite component's
    view template and possible view model as needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    With VComponents, adding a property starts with... writing code rather than
    JSON.  Yay!
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a revised version of our greeting component, now with a
    "preferredGreeting" property:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-props/with-props.tsx:</div>
    <code>
      1     import { h, Component } from 'preact';
      2     import { customElement, ExtendGlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      3
      4     type Props = {
      5       preferredGreeting?: string;
      6     }
      7
      8     /**
      9      * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
      10     */
      11    @customElement('oj-greet-with-props')
      12    export class GreetWithProps extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;&gt; {
      13
      14      render(props: Props) {
      15        const greeting = props.preferredGreeting;
      16
      17        return &lt;p&gt;{ greeting }, World!&lt;/p&gt;;
      18      }
      19
      20      static defaultProps: Partial&lt;Props&gt; = {
      21        preferredGreeting: "Hello"
      22      };
      23    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    As shown at line 4 above, a VComponent's properties are declared
    via a type alias.  By convention, we name this type "Props", though any
    name will do.  Each field in the type represents a single, public component
    property.  Fields are used to specify the property's name, type, and whether
    the a value for the field is optional or required.  Default values are specified
    in the static defaultProps field on the component class, as seen at line 20.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, we have declared a single "preferredGreeting" property
    of type string with the default value "Hello".  We mark the property as optional
    using TypeScript's optional ("?") indicator.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is one subtle requirement that may be easy to miss:
    in order to associate the properties class with the VComponent
    implementation, we need to specify the class as the value of the
    VComponent's first type parameter, "P".  This is shown at line 12.  Note
    that we use the <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#ExtendGlobalProps">
    ExtendGlobalProps</a> utility type to merge the component's own properties
    with the global HTML attributes defined by
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#GlobalProps">GlobalProps</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Accessing Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Any properties that we have declared are made available for use
    by the VComponent implementation through a special object:
    this.props.  In addition, properties are passed into the render method
    as the first argument. We can see an example of this usage at line #15,
    where we extract the value of the "preferredGreeting" property into
    a variable.  This variable subsequently influences the state
    of the rendered virtual DOM tree.  We embed the value of the
    preferredGreeting property into the virtual DOM at line #17.
  </p>
  <p>
    One critical point to keep in mind is that the property values
    in the props object are <b>always</b> defined by the consumer of the
    VComponent.  In the HTML case, the props object is populated based on
    attribute/property values specified on the custom element by
    the application.  In the case where the VComponent is being
    used within a parent VComponent, the property values are
    provided by the parent VComponent.  A VComponent implementation
    can read these property values, but must never mutate the
    props object.
  </p>
  <h2>HTML Usage</h2>
  <p>
    VComponents are embedded into HTML documents (eg. into an index.html
    file or a composite component or oj-module view template) using the
    custom element form.  The markup might look like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;oj-greet-with-props preferred-greeting="Hi"&gt;&lt;/oj-greet-with-props&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Which produces the following output:
  </p>
  <div class="output">
    <oj-greet-with-props preferred-greeting="Hi"></oj-greet-with-props>
  </div>
  <p>
    Note that when embedding a VComponent custom element in an HTML document
    or template, we use the same attribute naming
    rules as we use for all other JET custom elements: multi-word properties
    (eg. "preferredGreeting") are specified using hyphen-separated, kebab-case
    attribute names (eg. "preferred-greeting").  All of the usual
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/CustomElementOverview.html">
    JET Web Component conventions</a> for
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/CustomElementOverview.html#ce-attributes-section">
    attribute usage</a> apply.
  </p>
  <h2>JSX Usage</h2>
  <p>
    VComponents can also be embedded inside of other parent VComponents.
    As we saw in the
    <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('nesting')]]">
    </oj-tutorial-topic-link> topic,
    a VComponent parent can refer to a child in two different forms:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>As a custom element, using the string tag name.</li>
      <li>As a VComponent, using the Preact component class.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    Inside of JSX, we use the same naming convention for both of these forms:
    we always specify component properties using their camelCase property names.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a revised version of our parent greeting VComponent that
    demonstrates this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-props-parent/with-props-parent.tsx:</div>
    <code>
      1    import { h, Component } from 'preact';
      2    import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      3    import { GreetWithProps } from 'oj-greet/with-props/loader'
      4
      5    /**
      6     * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
      7     * @ojmetadata dependencies {
      8     *   "oj-greet-with-props": "^1.0.0"
      9     * }
      10     */
      11    @customElement('oj-greet-with-props-parent')
      12    export class GreetWithPropsParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
      13      render() {
      14        return (
      15          &lt;div&gt;
      16            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a custom element:&lt;/p&gt;
      17            &lt;oj-greet-with-props preferredGreeting="Hey there"/&gt;
      18
      19            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a VComponent class:&lt;/p&gt;
      20            &lt;GreetWithProps preferredGreeting="Hola"/&gt;
      21          &lt;/div&gt;
      22        );
      23      }
      24    }
      </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that for both the custom element case (line 17) and the
    VComponent class case (line 20), we use the "preferredGreeting"
    property name, not the "preferred-greeting" attribute name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the use of different naming conventions between
    HTML and JSX markup may be confusing at first, there is an
    important rationale for sticking with property names within
    JSX: type checking.  When specifying a JSX element like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    &lt;oj-greet-with-props preferredGreeting="Hey there"/&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Or this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    &lt;GreetWithProps preferredGreeting="Hola"/&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The properties on each JSX element are used to
    populate a "props" object that eventually ends up populating
    the child component's this.props field.  The type of this
    props object is based on the child VComponent's props type parameter.
    By sticking with the property names as declared by the
    VComponent's props type, we are able to type check (and catch
    errors in) the parent component's JSX.
  </p>
  <h2>Global HTML Attributes</h2>
  <p>
    In the above section, we discussed the naming convention to use
    when referencing component properties from within JSX: always
    use the component (camelCased) property name.   Ideally, we would
    like to use the same simple convention for global HTML attributes,
    such as "id" or "tabIndex". One problem with this approach is that
    not all global HTML attributes are exposed as properties.  For example,
    aria- and data- attributes do not have property equivalents.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leads to the following rules for working with global HTML
    properties/attributes:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the global HTML attribute is available as a property, use the
        property name.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the global HTML attribute is not available as a property,
        use the attribute name.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    In many cases, global HTML attribute names are identical to the property
    name (eg. "id", "title", "style").  However, there are some cases where
    the attribute and property name differ, or where the property name requires
    a specific case-folding.  For example, since attributes are case insensitive,
    HTML allows any capitalization of the "tabindex" attribute.  In JSX, we
    require that the actual property name "tabIndex" is used:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      protected render() {
        // While "tabindex" is a valid way to specify the tab index
        // in an HTML document, in JSX, the property name "tabIndex"
        // must be used.
        return &lt;div tabIndex={0} /&gt;
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    There is one noteworthy exception to the above rule.  Although
    the property name for specifying style classes is
    "className", this name is not especially well known.  Preact
    allows use of the more familiar attribute name, "class", eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      protected render() {
        // Can use "class" instead of "className"
        return &lt;div class="awesome-class" /&gt;
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <h2>ObservedGlobalProps</h2>
  <p>
    As discussed previously, all VComponents minimally support the set of global HTML attributes/properties
    defined by the GlobalProps/ExtendGlobalProps types. This means that consumers of your VComponent (whether
    they use the custom element tag or the VComponent class) can specify these global properties in their code.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, the VComponent implementation may need to inspect the value of a global property and to observe changes
    to that global property that would cause the VComponent to re-render itself. For these use cases, VComponents can express interest in specific
    global properties via the <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#ObservedGlobalProps">
    ObservedGlobalProps</a> utility type. This type allows specific global properties to be selected for observation via a type parameter.
    This ObservedGlobalProps type is combined with the component's other properties as part of the property declaration. We will see an
    example of ObservedGlobalProps in action in the <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('unique-ids')]]"></oj-tutorial-topic-link>
    topic, later in the tutorial.
