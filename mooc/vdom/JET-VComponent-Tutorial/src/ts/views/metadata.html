  <h1>Metadata</h1>
  <p>
    Before we get into more interesting aspects of the VComponent API,
    we have one more background topic to cover: component metadata.  JET
    Custom Components use metadata to express information that may be
    helpful both for tools and consumers.  For example, Oracle Visual Builder
    uses metadata to populate property editors and to drive other parts of the design
    time UI.  ojet CLI uses metadata for resolving component dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    A full list of component metadata can be found in the
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/MetadataOverview.html">
    JET Metadata</a> topic of the JET API documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    When authoring traditional composite components, metadata lives separately
    from the rest of the implementation in a component.json file.  As such,
    composite component authors typically end up having to modify three
    source files for each new feature: the view template, the view model
    and the component.json file.
  </p>
  <p>
    With VComponents, our goal is to move closer to a single file
    authoring experience.   Metadata is embedded directly in the
    VComponent module, not in a separate file. The component.json
    file is still needed to keep consuming tools happy.  However, this
    file is generated as a side effect of the VComponent build rather
    than hand coded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within a VComponent module, component metadata is derived from one of
    three sources:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>From <i>code constructs</i>.  For example, as we’ll see in the
      <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('props')]]">
      </oj-tutorial-topic-link> topic, a VComponent’s
    properties are declared as plain old type fields. "type" metadata,
    "enumValues" metadata, etc. can all be derived from the VComponent source at build time.</li>
    <li>From <i>TypeScript decorators</i>.  We have already seen one example of
    this: the @customElement decorator.  This decorator plays a dual role:
    it is used both at runtime to add custom element behavior to
    the VComponent, but is also used at build time as a source of the
    component’s “name” metadata.</li>
    <li>From <i>@ojmetadata doc annotations</i>.  If not otherwise derivable, @ojmetadata doc annotations
    can be added as a source for design time component metadata.  Documentation-based annotations should
    never be used for metadata that impacts runtime behavior (e.g., default property values).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    While we could introduce TypeScript decorators for describing all
    metadata, we have decided to limit our use of decorators to
    functionality that impacts runtime behavior.  For design time
    metadata, such as displayName, icon, license, etc…, metadata values
    are expressed via a documentation-based annotation rather than a real decorator.
    The primary rationale for this decision is that decorators are only
    valid in certain contexts (eg. on classes, methods and fields).
    However, component authors may need to define design time metadata in other parts
    of their code.  The annotation-based approach provides this
    flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The @ojmetadata annotation takes the following form:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    /**
     * @ojmetadata &lt;metadata field name&gt; &lt;metadata value&gt;
     */</code>
   </pre>
  <p>
    For example, we can enhance our HelloWorld component with some
    additional metadata:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    /**
     * @ojmetadata version “1.0.1”
     * @ojmetadata description “The *best* hello world component yet.”
     * @ojmetadata displayName “Hello World”
     * @ojmetadata extension {
     *    vbdt: {
     *      someVisualBuilderDesignTimeField: true
     *    }
     * }
     */
    @customElement('oj-hello-world')
    export class HelloWorld extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that each @ojmetadata annotation specifies a single name/value
    pair.  The values are injected directly into the generated
    component.json file, which  means that values must be valid JSON values.
    As shown above, string values should be double-quoted.  Object, array
    and primitive values can also be specified directly within the
    annotation (without quotes).
  </p>
  <p>
    While the above sample shows how to define component-level metadata by
    applying the @ojmetadata annotation to the VComponent class,
    the same technique can be used for all aspects of the VComponent API, including
    properties, methods, events and slots.
