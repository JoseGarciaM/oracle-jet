  <h1>The Loader Module</h1>
  <p>
    In the previous section, in order to import the oj-hello-world.tsx module,
    we referenced a module named "loader" rather than importing the "oj-hello-world"
    module directly.  For developers with experience building JET composite components,
    the loader module should already be familiar.  In the Composite Component
    Architecture, the loader module serves three purposes.  This module:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Loads the composite component's resources (eg. component.json,
        view template, view model, css)</li>
      <li>Registers the component with JET, by calling
        <a href="../../../jsdocs/Composite.html#register">
          Composite.register</a></li>
      <li>Serves as the main entry point into the composite component.  (This
        is what imports point to.)</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    For more details on the use of the loader module within composite components, see
     <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/jet-composite-components-ii-the-basics">
    JET Custom Components II - The Basics</a> in Duncan Mills'
    <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/cca">JET Custom Component Series</a>.
    In particular, look for "Step 5 - Examine the Component
    Bootstrap / Loader Script".
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the goals of the VComponent API is to provide a single file
    component authoring experience.  We are not totally there yet, as
    the component's css content lives in a separate file.  However, there
    is no need to create separate view template, view model or metadata
    files.  Instead:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>View templates are replaced by the render method.</li>
    <li>View models are replaced by component logic.</li>
    <li>Metadata lives within the component code,
      through a combination of code constructs, type information,
      decorators and doc annotations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition, there is no need for an explicit registration call (ie.
    no need for #2), as the presence of the @customElement decorator is
    sufficient to bring the VComponent to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given that we don't need to do any special resource loading or
    registration with VComponents, why do we bother with a loader module?
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is: loader modules are in no way a fundamental part
    of the VComponent API.  There is no long term requirement for these
    modules.  However, in the short term, there are several tools which
    rely on the Composite Component Architecture convention of having a
    module named "loader" serve as the main entry point for the
    component, including ojet CLI and Visual Builder
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, in order to allow VComponents to work
    properly with these tools, we are sticking with the composite
    component convention of having a separate loader module for
    each component. Our goal is to remove this requirement in a future JET
    release.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if we aren't actually loading resources or calling registration
    functions, what are we doing in VComponent loader modules?
    Not a whole lot.  Loader modules simply re-export the VComponent
    module class.  For example, the loader module for the HelloWorld
    component is simply:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      export { HelloWorld } from  "./oj-hello-world";</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    We will see examples of how this (re-)exported class may be used when
    authoring parent VComponents in later topics.
