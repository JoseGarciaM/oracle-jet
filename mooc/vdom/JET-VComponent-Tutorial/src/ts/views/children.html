  <h1>Children</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to exposing properties, components can also allow children to
    be passed in.  With custom elements, children are specified in one of
    two ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>As direct children, with no "slot" attribute.  This is also known as the default slot.</li>
    <li>As a named slot, with the name set via the "slot" attribute.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Components can leverage both of these approaches.  For example,
    the following <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojButton.html">
    oj-button</a> is configured both with
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojButton.html#Default">default slot</a>
    content as well as content in the
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojButton.html#startIcon">startIcon</a>
    named slot:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    &lt;oj-button&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;This is default slot content&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span slot="startIcon"&gt;This is named slot content&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/oj-button&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The VComponent API supports authoring of custom elements that expose
    default slots, named slots, or both.
  </p>
  <h2>Default Slots</h2>
  <p>
    As we examine the VComponent API's approach to dealing with
    children/slots, we are going to build upon a theme that we established in
    earlier topics: the VComponent API favors the use of code
    constructs over external metadata for defining a component's public API.
    Rather than opening up a component.json to declare a VComponent's
    children/slot contract through JSON metadata, we instead do the same thing
    we did for properties: write code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as we did with properties, we define a VComponent's children/slot
    contract by adding fields to a "props" class.  In particular, we
    indicate that a component can accept default slot content by declaring
    a "children" property of type ComponentChildren:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component, ComponentChildren } from 'preact';

      type Props = {
        preferredGreeting?: string;
        children?: ComponentChildren;
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    And of course we also need to associate the props class with the
    VComponent class via the P type parameter:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    @customElement('oj-greet-with-children')
    export class GreetWithChildren extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;&gt; {
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Once this is done, any default slot children will be made available
    to the VComponent implementation via props.children.  This is
    true regardless of whether the VComponent is used as a custom element
    within an HTML document, a custom element within JSX or via the
    VComponent's class within JSX.
  </p>
  <p>
    The VComponent implementation is free to place the default slot children anywhere
    within the component's virtual DOM tree.  For example, a
    VComponent-based oj-button likely would place these children inside of an
    HTML &lt;button&gt; element, eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      protected render(props: Props) {
        return &lt;button&gt; { props.children } &lt;/button&gt;;
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <h2>Named Slots</h2>
  <p>
    Like the default slot, named slots are also declared as fields on the
    props class.  Named slot declarations must adhere to two conventions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The named slot field must use the
      <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#Slot">Slot</a> type.</li>
    <li>The name of the field must match the slot name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The declaration for a slot named "startIcon" would look like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component, ComponentChildren } from 'preact';
      import { customElement, ExtendGlobalProps, Slot } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';

      type Props = {
        preferredGreeting?: string;
        children?: ComponentChildren;
        startIcon?: Slot;
      }

      /**
       * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
       */
      @customElement('oj-greet-with-children')
      export class GreetWithChildren extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;&gt; {
        render(props: ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;) {
          const { preferredGreeting, children, startIcon } = props;

          return &lt;p class="centerAlignVertical"&gt;
              {startIcon} {preferredGreeting}, {children}!
            &lt;/p&gt;;
        }

        static defaultProps: Partial&lt;Props&gt; = {
          preferredGreeting: "Hello"
        };
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Providing content for named slots is done in one of two ways,
    depending on the usage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the VComponent is used as a custom element, slot
    content is provided through child elements. The slot attribute identifies
    the name of the slot to target. This approach is used both for custom elements
    in HTML documents as well as for custom elements within
    JSX markup.</li>
    <li>When the VComponent is referenced through its class, named slot
    content is provided by specifying virtual DOM nodes directly as values
    for slot properties.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following parent component demonstrates both of these forms:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component } from 'preact';
      import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      import "ojs/ojavatar";
      import { GreetWithChildren } from 'oj-greet/with-children/loader'

      /**
       * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
       * @ojmetadata dependencies {
       *   "oj-greet-with-children": "^1.0.0"
       * }
       */
      @customElement('oj-greet-with-children-parent')
      export class GreetWithChildrenParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
        render() {
          return (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a custom element:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;oj-greet-with-children&gt;
                &lt;oj-avatar slot="startIcon" initials="HW" size="xs"&gt;&lt;/oj-avatar&gt;
                World
              &lt;/oj-greet-with-children&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a VComponent class:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;GreetWithChildren startIcon={&lt;oj-avatar initials="HW" size="xs"/&gt;}&gt;
                World
              &lt;/GreetWithChildren&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          );
        }
      }
      </code>
