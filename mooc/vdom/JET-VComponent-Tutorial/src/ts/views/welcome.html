  <h1>Welcome to VComponents!</h1>
  <p>
    The 11.0.0 release of JET introduces a new solution for creating
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/CompositeOverview.html">
    JET Custom Components</a>: the
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html">VComponent API</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with JET's <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/cca">
    Composite Component Architecture</a>, VComponents provide an easy way for developers
    to author their own <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">Web Components</a>.
    VComponents differ from composite components in one key way:
    VComponents leverage <a href="https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/">virtual DOM</a>
    rendering and <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> rather than
    <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>-based templates to produce
    their content.  As we will see, this has implications for how VComponents are
    authored and used.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tutorial provides an introduction to the new Preact-based VComponent API.  It is
    not intended to be a comprehensive guide to every aspect of VComponents.
    Instead, the goal of this tutorial is to help onboard new VComponent
    authors.  By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to create
    your own VComponents and incorporate these into your JET-based projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    One important thing to note before we dive in: while we are
    very excited about the VComponent API, we consider this to
    be an incremental addition rather than revolutionary change to the JET architecture.
    VComponents are designed to work seamlessly with existing JET applications. There
    is no need to rewrite your existing JET applications in order to
    start using VComponents.  VComponents can happily coexist with other
    JET components.  This tutorial is itself a demonstration of this
    principle, as it is a plain old JET app with some VComponents sprinkled
    throughout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same goes for your existing composite component-based
    JET Custom Components.  If you are happy building on top of the
    Composite Component Architecture, there is no reason for you to
    disrupt your development plans.  The Composite Component Architecture
    is not going away.  We feel that both composite components and VComponents
    are excellent options for component authoring.  You are free to pick
    whichever approach best meets your team's skill set and preferences.
  </p>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>
    The VComponent API builds on top of a number of technologies.  In
    addition to a general understanding of
    <a href="https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/">
    virtual DOM</a>, VComponent
    authors will need to be familiar with the following:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a>: Implementing
        a VComponent requires direct use Preact APIs.  Getting to know
        Preact is a good place to start.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html">TypeScript</a>:
	    All VComponents are authored in TypeScript.  Static types
            are your friends!
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/">JSX</a>: JSX defines a
	    mechanism for embedding markup content inside of
            ECMAScript. JSX can also be placed
	    <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">
	    inside of TypeScript</a> code as well.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">
	    ECMAScript modules</a>
	    (and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html">
	    TypeScript modules</a>): VComponents are authored
            using ECMAScript-style imports/exports.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html">
	    TypeScript decorators</a>: the VComponent API uses decorators to express
            information and behavior that would otherwise be difficult to express
            via code.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli">ojet CLI</a>:
	    we will use this command line tool to build our VComponents.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd">
	      AMD</a>: Although VComponents are authored as ECMAScript
	      modules, ojet CLI transpiles these to AMD for runtime usage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    In addition to the above, there are a few tangential subjects that
    will likely be of interest to VComponent authors:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
            <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/cca">
	    Composite Component Architecture</a>: while it is not a requirement
	    to master composite components, developers that are familiar with
	    composite components will see conceptual (and practical)
	    connections to the VComponent API.
      </li>
      <li>
            <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/advanced-components-jet-packs-part-1">
      JET Packs</a>: we expect that VComponent authors will typically create multiple, related
      VComponents, and as such will want to package these into JET Packs.
      </li>
      
      <li>
            <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/visual-builder/">
	      Oracle Visual Builder</a>: whether or not your own application is built using
        Visual Builder, Visual Builder users can import your JET Custom Components
        (including VComponents) into their applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
