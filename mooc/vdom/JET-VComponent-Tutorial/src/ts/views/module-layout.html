  <h1>Module Layout</h1>
  <p>
    As we saw in the previous topic, each custom element-based VComponent
    requires a bonus loader.ts module.  But where do VComponent modules
    and their loader counterparts live?
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we will be using the
    <a href="https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli">ojet CLI</a> to build our
    VComponents, we need to play by ojet CLI's rules.  ojet supports custom
    components in two
    forms:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Independent, loose components</li>
      <li>Components which are members of a
      <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/groundside/advanced-components-jet-packs-part-1">JET Pack</a></li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    The JET Pack approach is very much our preferred solution.  If you are
    developing/delivering more than one custom element-based component, placing
    your components in a JET Pack is without a doubt the way to go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you are planning to develop loose or JET Packed components
    you will need to follow ojet's conventions for where components
    live and how they should be structured.  We explore these conventions
    in the sections below.
  </p>
  <h2>Loose Components</h2>
  <p>
    All custom components (both composite
    and VComponents, loose and JET Pack'ed) must be placed under a well known
    directory.  As with most of the standard directories in an ojet app, the
    name of this directory is configurable.  By default the
    parent directory for custom components is named "jet-composites".
  </p>
  <p>
    For TypeScript-based applications (ie. for any
    application that contains VComponents), the jet-composites directory
    can be found at "src/ts/jet-composites".
  </p>
  <p>
    Since each custom element-based component has a module named "loader.ts",
    in order to avoid name conflicts we must place components in their own
    subdirectories under src/ts/jet-composites.  For loose components,
    the name of this subdirectory matches the component's custom element tag name.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example, our HelloWorld VComponent, which defines the "oj-hello-world"
    custom element tag, lives in the "src/ts/jet/composites/oj-hello-world"
    directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    For loose VComponents, the VComponent module name matches the custom element
    tag name with the ".tsx" extension tacked on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Putting the above rules together, we end up with the following
    directory structure for our sample HelloWorld component:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
  src/
    ts/
      jet-composites/
        oj-hello-world/
          loader.js
          oj-hello-world.tsx</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    You can check this out for yourself by downloading and unzipping
    the
    <a href="../../JET-VComponent-Tutorial.zip">
      VComponent Tutorial app</a>, which contains all
    of the content that you are reading, including all of the oj-sample
    VComponent implementations.
  </p>
  <h2>JET Pack Components</h2>
  <p>
    Components that live in JET Packs follow slightly different conventions.
    Each JET Pack has a name that is used as a prefix for its member
    components.  For example, the "oj-sample" JET Pack is a collection of
    sample components that are provided by the JET team.  The components
    in this JET Pack all have custom element tag names that are prefixed
    with "oj-sample", such as "oj-sample-calendar" or "oj-sample-drawer".
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than living in sub-directories directly under the jet-composites
    directory, JET Pack'ed components live in sub-directories under
    a directory named after the JET Pack.  The component-specific sub-directory
    as well as the component module omit the JET Pack prefix from their names.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if we port our "oj-hello-world" component over to an
    "oj-greet-hello" component which is a member of the (new) "oj-greet"
    JET Pack, this would have the following directory layout:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
  src/
    ts/
      jet-composites/
        oj-greet/
          hello/
            loader.js
            hello.tsx</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The import is also changed accordingly.  Rather than an import of the form:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import "oj-hello-world/loader";</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The JET Pack version looks like:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import "oj-greet/hello/loader";</code>
  </pre>
  <h3>Managing JET Packs With ojet CLI</h3>
  <p>
    When working with JET Packs, there are some additional requirements that
    must be met.  These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The JET Pack directory must contain a component.json metadata file that describes
      the contents of the JET Pack.  (See
      <a href="../../../jsdocs/ComponentPackOverview.html">
        JET Pack Metadata</a>.)
    </li>
    <li>Each component that is a member of the JET Pack must be specified in the component.json
      "dependencies" section.
    </li>
    <li>The path to JET Pack directory must be defined in the application's tsconfig.json.</li>
    <li>Each VComponent module must specify the name of the parent JET Pack via a jsDoc annotation.
      (More on this in the
      <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('metadata')]]">
      </oj-tutorial-topic-link> topic.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Rather than creating and configuring JET Packs and their contents manually,
    a better option is to let the ojet CLI help with this work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating a new JET Pack is as simple as:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      $ ojet create pack &lt;pack name&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    And adding a new VComponent to a JET Pack can be done with:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      $ ojet create component &lt;component name&gt; --pack=&lt;pack name&gt; --vcomponent</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Using the above commands, creating a new oj-greet-hello VComponent
    could be accomplished with two commands:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      $ ojet create pack oj-greet
      $ ojet create component hello --pack=oj-greet --vcomponent</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    This creates the oj-greet JET Pack and adds the oj-greet-hello VComponent, without
    having to worry about the directory structure or configuration details.
