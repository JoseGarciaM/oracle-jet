  <h1>Writeback</h1>
  <p>
    When working with JET custom elements, component properties can
    be mutated in several ways.  The application can retrieve a
    reference to the DOM element and directly set a property value.
    Or, in applications (or composite components) that are built with
    JET's binding layer, the property can be bound to an observable value
    defined by a view model.  When the observed value changes, the
    component property is updated and the component re-renders
    accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to these application-driven, "external" mutations,
    component property mutations can sometimes be triggered from
    within the component itself.  These "internal" mutations
    typically occur in response to user interaction.  For example,
    when the user enters a new value into an
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojInputText.html">
    oj-input-text</a> custom
    element, the component writes the user-entered value out to
    its <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojInputText.html#value">
    value</a> property.  Similarly, when the user toggles the
    expansion state of an
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojCollapsible.html">oj-collapsible</a>,
    the component reflects the new value by mutating its
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojCollapsible.html#expanded">expanded</a>
     property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Properties that can be mutated from within a component itself are
    known as
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/CustomElementOverview.html#ce-databind-writeback-section">
    writeback</a> properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the traditional JET architecture, changes to writeback
    properties are handled in one of two ways.
    The most common technique for responding to writeback property
    mutations is to set up a two-way binding:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;oj-input-text label-hint="Edit Me" value="{{ textValue1 }}"&gt;&lt;/oj-input-text&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Alternatively, the application can listen for property changed
    events, eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;oj-input-text label-hint="Edit Me Too" on-value-changed="[[ handleValueChanged ]]"&gt;&lt;/oj-input-text&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Examples of both of these can be seen below:
  </p>
  <p class="output">
    <oj-form-layout direction="row" columns="2">
      <oj-input-text label-hint="Edit Me" value="{{ textValue1 }}"></oj-input-text>
      <span tabindex="0">
        The value is: <oj-bind-text value="[[ textValue1 ]]"></oj-bind-text>
      </span>
      <oj-input-text label-hint="Edit Me Too" on-value-changed="[[ handleValueChanged ]]"></oj-input-text>
      <span tabindex="0">
        The value is: <oj-bind-text value="[[ textValue2 ]]"></oj-bind-text>
      </span>
    </oj-form-layout>
  </p>
  <p>
    When interacting with writeback properties from within a
    VComponent, the binding-based approach is not an option.  We
    can't set up a two-way binding expression, since VComponents do not
    use JET's binding layer.  Instead, VComponents use the
    event-centric approach, registering event listeners that respond
    to property changed events.  This looks something like:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component } from 'preact';
      import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      import { ojInputText } from "ojs/ojinputtext";
      import "ojs/ojinputtext";
      import "ojs/ojformlayout";

      type State = {
        value?: string
      }

      @customElement('oj-demo-writeback')
      export class DemoWriteback extends Component&lt;GlobalProps, State&gt; {

        state = {
          value: ""
        };

        render() {
          return (
            &lt;oj-form-layout&gt;
              &lt;oj-input-text value={ this.state.value }
                onvalueChanged={ this.handleValueChanged }
                labelHint="And Me Too!" /&gt;
              &lt;span tabIndex={ 0 }&gt;
                The value is: { this.state.value }
              &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/oj-form-layout&gt;
          );
        }

        private handleValueChanged = (event: ojInputText.valueChanged) =&gt; {
          this.setState({
            value: event.detail.value
          });
        }
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p class="output">
    <oj-demo-writeback></oj-demo-writeback>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the above example, we use a local state field to drive the child's
    value property.  When the value property changes, we update our local
    state, triggering a re-render.  On the subsequent render, we pass the
    state value back down into the oj-input-text and also use this to
    update our message.  For developers coming from the Preact/React
    world, this pattern should be familiar: we are treating the
    oj-input-text as a "controlled" component.  (For folks not familiar
    with this pattern, see
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components">
    Controlled Components</a>.)
  </p>
  <h2>Declaring Writeback Properties</h2>
  <p>
    The above example shows how to respond to writeback property
    changes within a parent VComponent by listening for property
    changed events.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also possible for custom element-based VComponents to
    expose writeback properties of their own.  In order to define a
    writeback property, the VComponent author actually declares two
    separate properties: one for the property itself and a second
    corresponding to the property changed listener.  As with
    Actions, property changed listener declarations must follow some
    specific conventions.  In particular:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The listener property must be named on&lt;PropertyName&gt;Changed, where
    "PropertyName" is the upper camel cased name of the writeback property.</li>
    <li> The listener property must be of type
      <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#PropertyChanged">PropertyChanged</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Building on our favorite example, if we wanted to build a greeting
    component that reveals its message in response to some user interaction,
    we could represent the revealed state via a writeback property, eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    type Props = {
      revealed?: boolean;
      onRevealedChanged?: PropertyChanged&lt;boolean&gt;;
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that the PropertyChanged type has a single
    type parameter that corresponds to the type of the writeback
    property.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the above Props type, the resulting custom element would have a single
    writeback property named "revealed".  When consumed within a traditional
    JET application, either two way binding or property changed
    listeners could be used to respond to user interaction.  Within a
    parent VComponent, listening for revealed property changes is the
    way to go.
  </p>
  <h2>Triggering Property Changes</h2>
  <p>
    Like Action, PropertyChanged is a
    function type:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    type PropertyChanged&lt;T&gt; = (value: T) => void;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The function takes a single argument: the new property value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The VComponent implementation invokes the property changed callback to
    indicate that a new value for a writeback property is available.
    Typically this happens in response to user interaction, though the
    VComponent can invoke this callback whenever it sees fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the following example, we trigger the property change in response
    to a button click:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component } from 'preact';
      import { customElement, ExtendGlobalProps, PropertyChanged } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      import { ojButton } from "ojs/ojbutton";
      import "ojs/ojbutton";

      type Props = {
        revealed?: boolean;
        onRevealedChanged?: PropertyChanged&lt;boolean&gt;;
      }

      /**
       * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
       */
      @customElement('oj-greet-with-writeback')
      export class GreetWithWriteback extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;&gt; {
        render({ revealed }) {
          const buttonMessage = `Click to ${revealed ? ' hide' : 'show'} your greeting!`

          return (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;oj-button onojAction={ this.handleAction }&gt;
                { buttonMessage }
              &lt;/oj-button&gt;
              &lt;div&gt;
                { revealed ? 'Hello, World!' : null }
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          );
        }

        private handleAction = (event: ojButton.ojAction) =&gt; {
          this.props.onRevealedChanged?.(!this.props.revealed);
        }

        static defaultProps: Partial&lt;Props&gt; = {
          revealed: false
        };
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    When an  VComponent is used as a custom element (ie. referenced via
    its custom element tag name), invoking the property changed callback
    results in the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The new property value is set on the custom element.</li>
    <li>A DOM property changed event is disptached.</li>
    <li>If the custom element is being used with JET's binding layer and has a two-way binding configured, the new value is written back into the binding.</li>
    <li>The VComponent is re-rendered with the new property value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When the VComponent is referenced via its class within a parent
    VComponent, invoking the property changed callback results in... well,
    this simply results in callback being invoked.  There is no DOM/custom
    element behavior in this case, and the VComponent is not automatically
    re-rendered.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is up to the parent VComponent to decide how to respond to these
    property changes.  One typical response is to store the new property
    value away in local state and use this to drive subsequent renders,
    similar to the controlled component pattern that we saw above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a sample parent VComponent that drives our GreetWithWriteback
    VComponent using local state:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      import { h, Component } from "preact";
      import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
      import { GreetWithWriteback } from 'oj-greet/with-writeback/loader'

      type State = {
        isRevealed: boolean;
      };

      /**
       * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
       * @ojmetadata dependencies {
       *   "oj-greet-with-actions": "^1.0.0"
       * }
       */
      @customElement('oj-greet-with-writeback-parent')
      export class GreetWithWritebackParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps, State&gt; {

        state = {
          isRevealed: false
        }

        render() {
          return (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This component is re-rendered in response to property changes:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;GreetWithWriteback revealed={ this.state.isRevealed }
                onRevealedChanged={ this.handleRevealedChanged } /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          );
        }

        private handleRevealedChanged = (newValue: boolean) =&gt; {
          this.setState({
            isRevealed: newValue
          });
        }
      }</code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Read-only Writeback Properties</h2>
  <p>
    One final note:  we've explored writeback properties as properties that can be set
    by the application upon the component, and can also be mutated within the component
    itself.  But components can also declare <em>read-only</em> properties that can only
    be mutated from within the component itself. For example, in addition to the
    oj-input-text custom element's <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojInputText.html#value">value</a>
    property, it also exposes a read-only
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/oj.ojInputText.html#rawValue">rawValue</a> property
    that reflects the user's input as they type.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whereas regular writeback properties require the VComponent author to declare two
    separate properties, a read-only writeback property only requires the declaration of
    a single property changed listener:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The listener property must be named on&lt;ReadOnlyPropertyName&gt;Changed, where
    "ReadOnlyPropertyName" is the upper camel cased name of the read-only writeback property.</li>
    <li> The listener property must be of type
      <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#ReadOnlyPropertyChanged">ReadOnlyPropertyChanged</a>.</li>
  </ul>
