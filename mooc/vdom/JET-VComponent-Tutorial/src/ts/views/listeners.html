  <h1>Listeners</h1>
  <p>
    Now that we know how to define component properties and children/slots,
    things are getting a bit more interesting.  Though we are still missing a
    key feature that will be central to most components: listening
    for and responding to events.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Preact, when listening for standard HTML events such as "click",
    listeners can be specified via properties of the form:
    on&lt;UpperCaseStandardEventName&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example, the following snippet shows how to register a
    "click" event listener:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    render() {
      return &lt;div onClick={this._handleClick}&gt;Click Me!&lt;/div&gt;
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, this naming convention does not apply to listeners
    for custom events, such as &lt;oj-button&gt;'s "ojAction" event.
    Instead, when registering event listeners for custom events on
    custom elements, the following convention is used: on&lt;customEventName&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    The folowing sample shows how to register a listener for the "ojAction" event:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    protected render() {
      return &lt;oj-button onojAction={this._handleAction}&gt;Click Me!&lt;oj-button&gt;
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that, unlike the standard "click" event case, with custom events the actual
    event type appears directly after the "on" prefix.  The first character of
    the custom event name is not upper cased.
  </p>
  <p>
    Event listeners
    are functions which take a DOM
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event">Event</a>
    and have no return value.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases, event listeners will need access to the VComponent
    instance.  There are various ways to accomplish this, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>An arrow function can be defined and used inline in the render method.</li>
    <li>A class method can be bound and saved away in the constructor.</li>
    <li>An arrow function can be declared and stored in a class field.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The latter two approaches have an advantage of the first option: they avoid
    re-creating a new function on each call to render().  By re-using the same
    function instance across all renders, these approaches
    avoid triggering unnecessary virtual DOM diffs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We typically use the class field approach, as it is slightly more concise.
    This is shown at line 20 below:

  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-listeners/with-listeners.tsx:</div>
    <code>
  1    import { h, Component } from 'preact';
  2    import { customElement, GlobalProps } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
  3
  4    /**
  5     * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
  6     */
  7    @customElement('oj-greet-with-listeners')
  8    export class GreetWithListeners extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
  9      render() {
  10        return (
  11          &lt;div&gt;
  12            &lt;div onClick={this._handleEvent}&gt;
  13              &lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;
  14            &lt;/div&gt;
  15            &lt;oj-button onojAction={this._handleEvent}&gt;Click Me&lt;/oj-button&gt;
  16          &lt;/div&gt;
  17        );
  18      }
  19
  20      private _handleEvent = (event: Event) =&gt; {
  21        console.log(`Received ${event.type} event`)
  22      }
  23    }</code>
   </pre>
  <p>A custom element instance of our GreetWithListeners VComponent can be found here:</p>
  <div class="output">
    <oj-greet-with-listeners></oj-greet-with-listeners>
  </div>
  <p>
    Try clicking on it and look for the output in the browser console.
