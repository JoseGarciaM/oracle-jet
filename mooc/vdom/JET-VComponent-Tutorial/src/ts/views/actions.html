  <h1>Actions</h1>
  <h2>Declaring Actions</h2>
  <p>
    In the previous topic, we saw how VComponents can listen for DOM
    events that are triggered in response to user interaction.  Aside
    from the standard DOM events that are fired by the browser,
    components need to be able to dispatch their own component-defined
    events as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    With traditional composite components, declaring and dispatching component events
    involves multiple files: first the event API is declared via
    component.json metadata, then event listeners are registered in the
    view template, and finally the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent">
    CustomEvent</a> is created and dispatched in the view model.
  </p>
  <p>
    The VComponent API streamlines this process.  If you have been
    following along the tutorial, hopefully you won't be surprised
    to hear that with the VComponent API, component events are declared
    via code instead of metadata.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each component event is specified by declaring a field in the "Props"
    class.  For reasons that we will dig into below, this field uses the
    same syntax as standard event listener properties, eg.
    "on&lt;UpperCaseEventName&gt;".
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example, if we want to add a "responseDetected" event to our
    greeting component that gets fired in response to user interaction (eg. such
    as a click), we would
    declare an "onResponseDetected" field in our Props class.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to sticking with the standard event listener property naming
    convention, fields that correspond to component events must use a
    specific type defined by the ojs/ojvcomponent module:
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/ojvcomponent.html#Action">Action</a>.  Thus we end up with a
    property declaration of the following form:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
    import { customElement, ExtendGlobalProps, Action } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';

    type Props = {
      preferredGreeting?: string;

      // This is an action declaration:
      onResponseDetected?: Action;
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <h2>Events vs Actions</h2>
  <p>
    In the above section, we have been mixing two terms: “event” and
    “action”. Within the VComponent space, these terms have distinct
    meanings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“event” specifically refers to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">DOM Events</a>
      that are dispatched via call to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent">dispatchEvent</a>.</li>
    <li>“action” is a higher-level abstraction for event-like APIs, which may
      or may not actually involve dispatching an Event at the DOM level.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This distinction arises due to the fact that, as discussed in the
    <oj-tutorial-topic-link topic="[[ getTopic('nesting')]]">
    </oj-tutorial-topic-link>
     topic, VComponents can be used in two ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>As a custom element, using the string tag name.</li>
    <li>As a VComponent, using the component class.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    When a VComponent is used as a custom element, invoking an action
    does in fact result in a DOM event being dispatched.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when referencing a VComponent via its VComponent class,
    no DOM event is created or dispatched.
    Instead, the action callback provided by the parent VComponent is
    invoked directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to support these two different usage models, we need a
    higher level abstraction than DOM events.  VComponent actions
    provide that abstraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    From here on out, we will stick with the term “action” when referring
    to the general behavior by which VComponents notify the outside world of
    activity.  We will use the term “event” specifically for cases when we
    need to refer to DOM events that are dispatched by custom (or plain old
    HTML) elements.
  </p>
  <h2>Dispatching Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Okay, so we have seen how to declare actions.  But how do we dispatch them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Action type is just a callback function type:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      <code>
        export type Action&lt;Detail extends object = {}&gt; = (detail?: Detail) =&gt; void;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In order to dispatch an action, the component simply invokes the
      Action-typed property as a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions are typically dispatched in response to some underlying event.  For
      example, our greeting component might dispatch the responseDetected action
      in response to a click:
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
      <code>
        private _handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) =&gt; {
          this.props.onResponseDetected?.();
        }</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the consumer of this component is not required to provide a
      value for onResponseDetected.  As such, we need to guard against a
      null this.props.onResponseDetected value.  Just as we did with slots, we
      can take advantage of TypeScript's support for the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">
      optional chaining operator</a> (?.).  This allows us to invoke the action
      callback if it is provided but short-circuit if not, without the need for
      a more verbose null check.
    </p>
  <h2>Responding to Actions</h2>
  <p>
    When an action is invoked, one of two things happens, depending on
    the usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the VComponent is being used as a custom element (either within
    an HTML document or within JSX in a parent VComponent), the
    VComponent framework creates an actual DOM CustomEvent and
    dispatches it via the custom element.  The
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type">event type</a>
    is derived from the name of the action property by removing the "on" prefix
    and lower casing the first letter.  So, invoking the "onResponseDetected"
    action results in a DOM event type of "responseDetected" being dispatched.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the VComponent is being used by a parent VComponent and is
    referenced by its class rather than the custom element
    name, no DOM event is created.  If the parent provides a
    value for the action property, this is invoked directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In JSX markup, action callbacks are always
    specified using the action property name.  This is true regardless
    of whether the parent references the child VComponent by its
    custom element name of class:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a custom element:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;oj-greet-with-actions onresponseDetected={this.handleResponse}/&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a VComponent class:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;GreetWithActions onResponseDetected={this.handleResponse}/&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    However, if the custom element lives within an HTML document, event
    listeners are typically registered with JET's
    <a href="../../../jsdocs/CustomElementOverview.html#toc21">event binding syntax</a>.
    This might look something like:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;oj-greet-with-actions
        on-response-detected="[[ expressionPointingToEventHandler ]]"&gt;
      &lt;/oj-greet-with-actions&gt;
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    Though it is also possible to call the DOM
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">
      addEventListener</a> API directly.
  </p>
  <h2>Action Payloads</h2>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that Action is a generic type with a
    "Detail" type parameter, though we have not taken advantage of this
    yet.  The Detail type parameter comes in handy when the action needs
    to deliver additional information beyond just the action type.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, our greeting component may want to include a flag along
    with the responseDetected action to indicate urgency.  This would be
    declared using the Detail type parameter as follows:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
  type Props = {
    preferredGreeting?: string;
    onResponseDetected?: Action&lt;{
      urgent: boolean;
    }&gt;;
  }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    When invoking the action, the detail payload is passed in as an
    argument to the action callback, eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      private _handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) =&gt; {
        // Pass in a detail payload.  Determine urgency based on
        // number of clicks.
        this.props.onResponseDetected?.({
          urgent: event.detail &gt; 1
        });
      }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The Detail type parameter can also be specified using a type alias,
    eg:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
  export type ResponseDetectedDetail = {
    urgent: boolean;
  }

  type Props = {
    preferredGreeting?: string = 'Hello';
    onResponseDetected?: Action&lt;ResponseDetectedDetail&gt;
  }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    On the consuming side, there is one subtlely in how the detail
    payloads are accessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the custom element case, the action callback is literally
    registered as a DOM
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener">
    EventListener.</a> That is, when using this form:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
          &lt;oj-greet-with-actions onresponseDetected={this.handleEventResponse}/&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The callback acts as a true DOM event listener, and as such will receive a
    single "event" argument of type CustomEvent&lt;Detail&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when using the VComponent class form:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <code>
      &lt;GreetWithActions onResponseDetected={this.handleActionResponse}/&gt;</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The callback will again receive a single argument, but of type Detail
    rather than CustomEvent&lt;Detail&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    The difference between custom element usage and VComponent class usage
    is admittedly non-obvious.  Our recommendation for VComponent authors
    is to leverage the VComponent class form when that is available.
  </p>
  <h2>All Together Now</h2>
  <p>
    Putting it all together, our greeting component ends up as:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-actions/with-actions.tsx:</div>
    <code>
    import { h, Component } from 'preact';
    import { customElement, ExtendGlobalProps, Action } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';

    export type ResponseDetectedDetail = {
      urgent: boolean;
    }

    type Props = {
      preferredGreeting?: string;
      onResponseDetected?: Action&lt;ResponseDetectedDetail&gt;;
    }

    /**
     * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
     */
    @customElement('oj-greet-with-actions')
    export class GreetWithActions extends Component&lt;ExtendGlobalProps&lt;Props&gt;&gt; {
      render(props: Props) {
        return (
          &lt;div onClick={this._handleClick}&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;{props.preferredGreeting}, World!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }

      private _handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) =&gt; {
        // Pass in a detail payload.  Determine urgency based on
        // number of clicks.
        this.props.onResponseDetected?.({
          urgent: event.detail &gt; 1
        });
      }

      static defaultProps: Partial&lt;Props&gt; = {
        preferredGreeting: "Hello"
      };
    }</code>
      </pre>
  <p>
    And our parent component is:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    <div class="filename">oj-greet/with-actions-parent/with-actions-parent.tsx:</div>
    <code>
    import { h, Component } from 'preact';
    import { customElement, GlobalProps, Action } from 'ojs/ojvcomponent';
    import { GreetWithActions, ResponseDetectedDetail } from 'oj-greet/with-actions/loader';

    /**
     * @ojmetadata pack "oj-greet"
     * @ojmetadata dependencies {
     *   "oj-greet-with-actions": "^1.0.0"
     * }
     */
    @customElement('oj-greet-with-actions-parent')
    export class GreetWithActionsParent extends Component&lt;GlobalProps&gt; {
      render() {
        return (
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a custom element:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;oj-greet-with-actions onresponseDetected={this.handleEventResponse}/&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This child is rendered as a VComponent class:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;GreetWithActions onResponseDetected={this.handleActionResponse}/&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }

      private handleEventResponse = (event: CustomEvent&lt;ResponseDetectedDetail&gt;) =&gt; {
        this.logResponseDetected(event.detail.urgent);
      }

      private handleActionResponse = (detail: ResponseDetectedDetail) =&gt; {
        this.logResponseDetected(detail.urgent);
      }

      private logResponseDetected(urgent: boolean) {
        const responseType = urgent ? 'Urgent' : 'Non-urgent';
        console.log(`${responseType} response detected.`);
      }
    }</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Which can be seen in "action" here:
  </p>
  <p class="output">
    <oj-greet-with-actions-parent></oj-greet-with-actions-parent>
  </p>
