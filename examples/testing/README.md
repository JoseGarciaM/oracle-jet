# Testing Oracle JET

I’ve been working with Oracle JET for a few months now. I’m impressed, but one thing I’ve found lacking is much community documentation on how to test JET apps and the confusion on testing them. I thought I’d write an introductory post on testing Oracle’s JET applications. In this repo you will find samples in MVVM and VDOM architectures.

## Prerequesites
1) [Install Node.js](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/developer-tools/jet/10/develop/choose-development-environment-oracle-jet.html#GUID-2B7F94A4-0699-47B6-96A9-C6E94B1BCF10)

2) Install Oracle JET Tooling

```bash
[sudo] npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli
```
3) Run the following to check installation succeeded and to see the available commands:

```bash
ojet help
```
